            <h5>Essay</h5>
            <p>I am almost becoming overwhelmed by the responsibility of responding to the sky. The more I pay attention to it, the more
              there is to notice. There is almost not enough time to write it all down, particularly as it constantly shifts. In fact, the 
              sky is never not active. The myth that the sky becomes black at night is easy enough to disprove. Only look up at night and
              you will find it full of incident, albeit of a subtler nature than that with which it is colored during the day. There are
              infinite shades of gray and darkness, clouds are visible, and the lights continue to change, depending on the celestial
              bodies. Stars create elaborate punctuations and phrasing, causing some to postulate on their arrangements. Then there is
              the moon.
