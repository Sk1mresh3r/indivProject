            <p>Through the course of human history, most societies have enjoyed peace, most of the time. In fact, some societies have
              avoided war altogether or for very long periods. One study found that a tenth of societies never experienced war and over
              half experienced it only once a generation.
            </p>
            <p>Humans alive today are also less likely to die as a result of wars or atrocities than their parents or grandparents. War
              in East Asia is at its lowest point in centuries and has been for nearly three decades. War is almost extinct in the Americas,
              Caribbean, and western Europe. It is now uncommon in eastern Europe, southern African and increasingly in coastal west Africa.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, for as long as there has been war, there have been people trying to find ways of resolving disputes without
              it. The very first human story written down, the epic of Gilgamesh (c. 1500-2000 BCE), recounts how this King of Uruk learns
              that war and conquest cannot give him immortality. Gilgamesh finds meaning in life by becoming a wise and just king and
              abandoning the wanton violence of his past.
